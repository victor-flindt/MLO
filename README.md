MLO_project
==============================

Pytorch ecosystem: Transforms.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification

As of now the group will be focusing on a sentiment-tweet-analysis data set from Kaggle. The data set consist of around 40k training points and 4k test points, distributed over 6 columns; name, Username Tweeted from, Tweeted at, Twitter text and sentiment which is itself spread out over 5 categories. 

The goal of the project (based on the current dataset) is to predict the sentiment of a tweet, this will give us a rough idea of what the tweet is about in buzzwords.
Before training it is already obvious that some data cleaning will be needed as the raw data is unfiltered tweets, some containing "#", article links, "@" to other accounts etc. 

The training will be run in docker containers, and the output will be displayed on wandb (Link will follow later).
